nwseq is mainly intended to be used on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It runs on
Windows with ActiveState ActivePerl too.  

Using Perl 5.8.9 or better is highly recommended, because nwseq needs bignum, which breaks Getopt::Long 
in some older versions of Perl. 

Installing nwseq should be easy:
- Just copy the nwseq script to a directory in the PATH and make it executable. For example:
  $ sudo install -m 0755 nwseq /usr/local/bin
- Copy the man page file to the man page directory. For example:
  $ sudo install -m 0644 nwseq.8 /usr/local/man/man8

If your Perl interpreter is not in /usr/bin, you will have to adjust the Perl interpreter path 
in the first line of the script. For instance, if your perl interpreter is in /usr/local/bin, 
the first line of nwseq should be:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl

If you want to run the unit tests, you'll need the Perl module 'Test::Simple':
- Install Perl CPAN, if it's not installed yet. For instance:
  $ sudo yum install perl-CPAN
- Start a CPAN-shell:
  $ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
- Install Test::Simple from the CPAN shell:
  > install Test::Simple
