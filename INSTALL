Installing nwseq should be easy:
- Just copy the nwseq script to a directory in the PATH and make it executable. For example:
  $ sudo install -m 0755 nwseq /usr/local/bin
- Copy the man page file to the man page directory. For example:
  $ sudo install -m 0644 nwseq.8 /usr/local/man/man8

If your Perl interpreter is not in /usr/bin, you will have to adjust the Perl interpreter path 
on the first line of the script. For instance, if your perl interpreter is in /usr/local/bin, 
the first line of nwseq should be:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
