.SH DESCRIPTION

nwseq prints a sequence of values (from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT). The currently supported value types are: decimal integers, 
MAC addresses and IPv4 addresses. 

MAC addresses should be in IEEE 802.3 format (e.g. 12-34-12-34-12-34 or 12:34:12:34:12:34) or 
in Cisco format (e.g. 1234.1234.1234). 

nwseq can also print all addresses in an IPv4 subnet, or print a list of subnets with a specified prefix length within a larger IPv4 subnet. Subnets should be in CIDR notation (e.g. 10.11.12.0/24). 

.SS OPTIONS

Supported options:
.TP
\fB \-i \fP
Includes the network address and the broadcast address of the subnet in the output. This option can only be used on IPv4 subnets.

.TP
\fB \-w \fP  or \fB --equal-width \fP
Equalizes output width by padding numbers with leading zeroes. This option can only be used in combination
with decimal integer command line arguments.

.TP
.BI \-\-help
Displays a help message and exits

.TP
.BI \-\-version
Displays version information and exits

.SS EXAMPLES

.TP
\fBnwseq 10\fP
Prints all numbers from 1 to 10

.TP
\fBnwseq -w 90 110\fP
Prints all numbers from 90 to 110, with equal width output

.TP
\fBnwseq 10.0.0.250 10.0.1.10\fP
Prints all IPv4 addresses from 10.0.0.250 to 10.0.1.10

.TP
\fBnwseq 0000.1000.2000 2 0000.1000.2010\fP
Prints every other MAC addresses from 0000.1000.2000 to 0000.1000.2010.

.TP
\fBnwseq 10.0.0.0/29\fP
Prints all IPv4 addresses in subnet 10.0.0.0/29, except for the network address and
the broadcast address

.TP
\fBnwseq 10.0.0.0/24 /29\fP
Prints all /29-subnets within IPv4 subnet 10.0.0.0/24
